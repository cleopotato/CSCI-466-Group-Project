# CSCI-466-Group-Project
A group project I took part in during my time in NIU for a Database class I took.
The main goal was to build a web-based, database-driven, online store that can handle transactions while utilizing a variety of programming languages and tools.

I was responsible for creating the database, designing/building the website, and implementing the Add-To-Cart (ATC) and Login system for both customers/employees.

**NIU's server will eventually take it down so it is here for preservation**
